# Linking genes to GWAS loci in keratinocytes

## Welcome!
This repository contains part of the code to reproduce the main results of *"Chromatin looping links target genes with genetic risk loci for dermatological traits"*.
This can also be used with HiChIP produced in different cell types or with different GWAS results, such as loci not reaching genome wide significance or credible SNP sets.

The preprint of the manuscript is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.973271v2

Please note that this paper is still a work in progress and some parts of the analysis might change in the future.
Moreover, this code has been edited from the original to allow easier usage by other people but it produces the same results as presented in the paper.
